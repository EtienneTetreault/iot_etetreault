Todo:
  ☐ Test IoTWebConfig instead of WifiManager. Test ESPHome. All to save secret credential (Wifi and MQTT)
  ☐ Test sleep mode to run remote_scale on battery?
  ☐ Test use of File transfer protocol (FTP) like FileZilla/Samba for storing public files (music?) on Raspberry Pi (instead of Apache)
  ☐ Test / investigate on Alarm_clock : why is MP3 buffer empty on radio? Problem streaming? See todo tag in main_alarmclock.cpp
  ☐ On Alarm_clock: Test/validate watchdog / MQTT message for MQTT reboot and MP3 buffer empty. See todo tag in main_alarmclock.cpp and in Main.js!!
  ☐ On Alarm_clock: Delete all fuckup printf, print(F()) and printf_P(PSTR()). What is it, seem to make the esp reboot...
  ☐ On NodeRed : Create a way to log error message. Show them on Dashboard? Create alert on Dashboard/Cellphone?
  ☐ On NodeRed : Create backup of flow in json and store with JS script on github?
