Todo:
  ☐ On Alarm_clock, creatte MQTT message to broadcast State and Warning
  ☐ On node red : clean up !!
  ☐ Test IoTWebConfig instead of WifiManager. Test ESPHome. All to save secret credential (Wifi and MQTT)
  ☐ Test sleep mode to run remote_scale on battery?
  ☐ Xstate alarmclock : wait for music status "Idle/Play" before stansition. Resend if not.
  ☐ Xstate alarmclock : Stop / CleanUp from UI toggle switch not working....
  ☐ Xstate alacrmclock : Download right music and confirm alarm states...
