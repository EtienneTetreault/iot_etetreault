Todo:
  ☐ On Alarm_clock, creatte MQTT message to broadcast State and Warning
  ☐ On node red : clean up !!
  ☐ Test IoTWebConfig instead of WifiManager. Test ESPHome. All to save secret credential (Wifi and MQTT)
  ☐ Test sleep mode to run remote_scale on battery?
  ☐ Test use of File transfer protocol (FTP) like FileZilla for storing public files (music?) on Raspberry Pi (instead of Apache)
  ☐ Xstate alarmclock : wait for music status "Idle/Play" before stansition. Resend if not.
  ☐ On Alarm_clock: Integrate Led driver TM1809, and delete delete LedControler class
  ☐ On Alarm_clock: Integrate FastLed library with TM1809 and maybe use led sequence/MQTT from ESParkle?
